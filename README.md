# General Scripts
Hi there,

Here you will find all the scripts that I use on a daily basis, and in my articles at Techgenix.com. The current list of scripts and tools in the current repo is listed below:

  <b>Check-Media.ps1</b><br>
  Provide the filename and checksum and the script will validate if they match. There is an optional parameter to specify the algorithm (by default is SHA1).
